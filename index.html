    <div>symptoms, etiology, pathology and prognosis. This system was developed during the
early 1990s by Massachusetts General Hospital and has been used by thousands of
physicians and medical students.<br><br>
DXplain uses a set of signs, symptoms, and laboratory results to produce a ranked list
of diagnoses which might explain the clinical manifestations. DXplain uses Bayesian
logic to derive the clinical diagnosis interpretation (MedExpert-DxPlain, 2004). It is
important to note that the system only provides suggestion and not definitive conclusions. Since this system is in production and licensed as a product, the knowledge base
should be continually updated.<br><br>
DXplain is routinely used at medical schools for clinical education. DXplain diagnosis
decision system has characteristics of an electronic medical textbook and a reference
system. After receiving the inputs, the system develops a list of ranked diagnosis based
on the input and provides the justification. This is one of the main reasons why this
system is used widely for education purposes.<br><br>
DXplain system provides about 10 appropriate references for each suggested diagnosis.
The user interface for the DXplain system is very intuitive with graphical user interface
requiring only clicks from the lists to drill down to the recommendations. This is one of
the main reasons suggested for the success of this product.</div><br>
    <h3>RMRS<br>
    ________________________________________________________________________________</h3>
    <div>Regenstrief Medical Records System (RMRS) is one of the oldest, popular, and commonly cited decision support system in the United States. RMRS, developed at Indiana
University, is a hospital-based medical information system with decision support
capabilities like preventive care reminders and advice regarding cost- effectiveness
details during physician order entry.<br><br>
As early as 1974, RMRS began to deliver paper generated automatic reminders to the
physicians the night before a patient’s visit. This intelligent system reviewed the
patient’s medical record against the set of pre-defined protocols to generate reminders
about the patient’s condition and to suggest corrective actions. In 1984, this reportbased decision support system was programmed into an interactive Gopher-based
system to break the long list of reminders into logical groups, allowing physicians to step
through the reminders during the physician order entry process. The success of RMRS
system was due to the fact that the decision support functions were integrated with the
hospital information system. The availability of required data and the knowledge base
makes this a powerful system. The decision support capabilities made available to the
decision makers at the point of care made this an effective product.<br><br>
In the past decade, RMRS went through a lot of developments and has included various
decision support techniques such as pattern recognition and intelligent agents to help
physicians assess the patterns of care and identify patients with particular risk factors
and adverse outcomes. This system is used at more than 40 inpatient and outpatient
facilities and the commercial version is marketed internationally.</div>

    <h3>PRODIGY<br>
    ________________________________________________________________________________</h3>
    <div>PRODIGY (PROject prescribing rationally with Decision support In General practice
study) is a prescribing decision support system that offers evidence-based, cost
effective general practice prescribing. The Sowerby Center of Health Informatics at
Newcastle University was approached by the English National Health Service Executive
during 1995 to develop a medical decision support system to guide UK general practitioners on therapeutic actions covering prescribing. While developing PRODIGY, the
research team realized the importance of integration with already existing general practice
software used by the general practitioners. Hence integration with all the five major
general practice software in the UK was performed to make PRODIGY a powerful medical
decision support system.<br>
While several medical decision support systems assist in diagnosing the problem,
PRODIGY starts after the diagnosis is made by providing medical advice and therapeutic
recommendations (MedExpert-Prodigy, 2004). The system also stores patient information leaflets containing information about the disease in simple terms. The trigger for
decision support within PRODIGY is the input of diagnosis code. Once the physician
enters the diagnosis code in their general practice system, it activates PRODIGY decision
support to check if suitable medical recommendations are available. The decision maker
at that point has the option to explore the recommendations or ignore it. When explored,
the decision maker will be presented with therapy scenarios, evidence-based prescribing,
and availability of patient information leaflets along with justification and references for
the recommendations. PRODIGY medical decision support system has been successfully
implemented nation wide at all general practitioners in the UK.</div>
    <h3>CADIAG – II (Computer Assisted DIAGnosis)<br>
    ________________________________________________________________________________</h3>
    <div>CADIAG – II is a hospital-based medical decision support system developed by the
Department of Medical Computer Sciences at University of Vienna. CADIAG decision
support system has been integrated with the medical information system of the Vienna
General Hospital.<br>
CADIAG decision support system focuses on the colon diseases, rheumatic diseases,
gall bladder, pancreatic diseases, and bile duct diseases (MedExpert-Cadiag, 2004). This
medical decision support system provides online consultation support for the physician
to assist in diagnosis of the diseases given the signs, symptoms, etiology, and laboratory
results. This system contains a very strong knowledge database in the specialty areas
of colon diseases and rheumatic diseases.</div>
    <h3> NeoGanesh

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>support system is one of the very few automated and controlled system with very limited
human intervention. This real time medical decision support system checks for the real
time data and controls the mechanical assistance provided to the patients suffering from
lung diseases in a pressure supported ventilation mode (Dojat, Pachet, Guessoum,
Touchard, Harf, & Brochard, 1997). The other interesting feature of the system is to
develop a therapeutic strategy to respond to the patients and evaluate the capacity to
breathe. This system is used at Henri Mondor Hospital in France. This system is being
planned to be released for commercial purpose as well.</div>

    <h2>Medical Decision Support<br>
Knowledge Sharing<br>_______________________________________________________________</h2>
    
    <h3>Overview<br>________________________________________________________________________________</h3>
    <div>The field of medicine has been a pioneer in the introduction of decision support systems.
One of the first expert systems to be developed was in the field of medicine. The
complexity of decision making in the field of medicine and the challenge of keeping up
to date with the new findings and research has been a key motivator for the usage of
medical decision support systems. As discussed in the previous sections, numerous
medical decision support systems exist in the market. The knowledge for most of these
medical decision support systems are acquired from the clinical practice guidelines
issued by various government and medical associations. Clinical practice guidelines are
the rule-based knowledge that guides the decision makers in a medical setting. These
guidelines have been developed over the years to reduce the variations among medical
practices with a common goal to provide cost effective and high quality healthcare
services (Field & Lohr, 1992).<br><br>
Healthcare organizations historically have focused more on the development of the
clinical practice guidelines compared to the implementation of the guidelines (Grimshaw
& Russell, 1993). Past research studies have proved that the computerized medical
decision support systems when integrated with the clinical workflow can improve the
practitioners’ compliance with clinical practice guidelines and outcomes (Johnsons,
Langton, Haynes & Mathieu, 1994). Thus, it was clear that the medical decision support
systems are best vehicles to promote compliance. The availability of several decision
support systems and the use of common knowledge and rules triggered the need for a
common method of sharing the knowledge. This technique can save the cost of
developing the same medical practice guidelines for multiple decision support systems.
While it is common among organizations to share the data and information between
computer systems, sharing the knowledge was a challenge. While knowledge sharing
could be considered as losing competitive advantage, the healthcare industry was one
of the few industries where several guidelines are common as they are generally
developed by government agencies or medical associations. The medical arena rose to
the occasion and various associations were involved in development of a standard way

following sections, the various prominent clinical practice guideline models and knowledge sharing standards are discussed.</div>
    <h3>ARDEN Syntax<br>    ________________________________________________________________________________</h3>
    <div>ARDEN Syntax is an ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and ANSI
(American National Standard Code for Information Interchange) standard a hybrid
knowledge representation format that was created with the main aim to address the ability
to share, reuse, and understand the medical knowledge base. It is first introduced in 1989
at the Columbia University’s Arden homestead conference. The initial idea for the
conference was to create a knowledge representation format that can facilitate the
definition of knowledge bases and thus could result in an effective implementation of new
knowledge consistently (Hripcsak, Pryor & Wigertz, 1995). The development of knowledge bases is the biggest challenge faced by the ever changing medical field and
introducing a knowledge representation format was thought to be of significant help to
allow various institutions to share their knowledge among medical decision support
systems.<br><br>
The ARDEN syntax was largely derived from the logical modules used by the HELP and
RMRS medical decision support systems. The concept of the ARDEN syntax is to
develop rule-based modular logical rules called medical logical modules (MLM). The
medical decision support system that is based on Arden Syntax polls for the occurring
events and executes the MLM’s out of its knowledge base that has defined the occurring
event as the triggering condition.<br><br>
In ARDEN syntax, the MLM’s are composed of slots that are grouped into three
categories called maintenance, library, and knowledge. Each category has a set of
predefined slots. The slots are broadly classified as textual slots, textual list slots, coded
slots, and structured slots. The maintenance category contains the slots that specify
general information about the MLM like title, mlmname, arden syntax version, mlm
version, institution, author, specialist, date, and validation. The library category contains slots about the knowledge base maintenance that is related to the module’s
knowledge. This category contains the relevant literature, explanation, and links that
were used in defining the MLM. The library category slots are purpose, explanation,
keywords, citations and links. The knowledge category contains the slots that specify
the real knowledge of the MLM. The knowledge category dictates the triggering event
of the MLM and the logic of the MLM. The knowledge category slots are type, data,
priority, evoke, logic, action, and urgency.</div>
